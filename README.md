# Welcome to OpenLanguageInterace (OLI)
OLI is a collection of tools built throughout the development of Trelent to help people
interact with language models in intuitive ways. This is an active project, and we are
currently porting internal tooling into a framework that fits here.

## Philosophy
OLI has "open" in the name for a reason. Language models are too powerful to have been
hidden behind closed doors. Tooling to use them should be truly democratic by:
1. being 100% open-source
2. being easy to use
